# Password Generator Version 1.0

## Usage
### To use this password generator simply create 2 word lists.
nounlist: contains all the nouns you'd like to use when generating passwords
adjectivelist: contains all the adjectives you'd like to use when generating passwords

### Run the application
After you've created your word lists either compile the code to binary or use go run

## Notes
Currently working on snap to make it easy/fun to install for Linux users and put into personal use. Snap will include the nounlist and adjectivelist; these can be edited by the user, if needed. 

### Disclaimer
This is a constant work in progress. It was made for me to use and have fun with. If you chose to use it
you are using it at your own risk.
